*WORK STILL IN PROGRESS. CODE IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE*

#### YET ANOTHER GRID SYSTEM

TODO:
- [x] Make a todo list
- [ ] CSS generation provided by app
- [ ] SASS function to generate a grid with fallback
- [ ] LESS function to generate a grid with fallback
- [ ] Javascript function to create strings corresponding to grid with fallback
- [x] ~CSS-Modules function to generate a grid with fallback~ a ha ha, hell no.

A small webapp to generate your own grid system based on css-grids with flexbox fallbacks!
Just copy and paste into your own project!

Or, maybe I'll make it so you can import the css/sass/less/function into your app!

### Running the app locally

It's as simple as...
```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```
